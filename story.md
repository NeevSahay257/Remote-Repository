My Story
Once upon a time , in a forest , lived a monkey who resided on an almond tree. It was on the banks of the river. In the river , a crocodile and his wife lived.
One day the crocodile came to the banks and rested under the Almond Tree and the kind hearted monkey offered the crocodile some almonds.
