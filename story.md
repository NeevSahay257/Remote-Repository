My Story
Once upon a time , in a forest , lived a monkey who resided on an almond tree. It was on the banks of the river. In the river , a crocodile and his wife lived.
One day the crocodile came to the banks and rested under the Almond Tree and the kind hearted monkey offered the crocodile some almonds.
The crocodile started coming everyday and they become friends. Altought the monkey's plans were different. The monkey thought that the crocodiles could be a threat and he told the other animals to attack the crococdile. So one day the monkey made a lion hide and wait for the crocodile to come . When the crocodile came the lion ran and attacked the crocodile but the crocodile's wife came and saved him and the monkey was then eaten by the crocodiles.
